Cabify Mobile Challenge
1	Besides providing exceptional transportation services, Cabify also runs a physical store which sells (only) 3 products:
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
VOUCHER      | Cabify Voucher      |   5.00€
TSHIRT       | Cabify T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Cafify Coffee Mug   |   7.50€
Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:
•	The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on VOUCHER items.
•	The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more TSHIRT items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.
Cabify's checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid. 

2	Multiuser platform
It has been considered that several users may be connected at the same time, so the Checkout process must use the active user’s cart to show the price and fulfill the payment process

3	Cabify Shop flowchart
As shown in the flowchart, the main process of the user connection and menu navigation options will follow the conditions drawn.
